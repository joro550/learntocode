Well I'm glad you asked! My name is Mark - I am a professional software developer, I have been coding since I  can remember - I remember the first time I figured out that you could tell a computer what you wanted to do, my mind surged with possibilities and ideas and I wanted nothing more to learn how to do it. I started with a programming language called ActionScript, a name you may or may not be familier with - it is what powered Flash, and for many years was the programming language of choice for website games. 

After a couple of years I eventually started specialising in computing, going to college I started learning and developing some software in c++ and I am glad that github wasn't really around in those days because some of the code  I wrote, well you should have seen it! But that is the cool thing, at the end of the day it doesn't matter what code looks like as long as it works.

I say this knowing I will have to discuss many of the practices and principles of working on a longer term project nad within a team and something people can't forget, when we write software to last we need to make it so that not only we can understand it, we have to use techniques and language that is accessible.

I have been a professional developer for 7 years now and a hobbyist for much longer, I'm hoping this little website might become a resource for people who want to learn not "how to code" but more how to solve problems through code. I do not prfess that I have all the answers I don't, but I hope I can at least give you some core concepts to help you get started in this wonderful world.

I believe anyone can do anything they set their mind to! If this website helps at least one person on their journey to building professional enterprise sofwtare or helps one person automate a task from one hour to 5 minutes I will be happy.

Now - get coding :D
