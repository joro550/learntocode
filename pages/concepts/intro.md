There are some concepts that are the same not matter where or how you are programming - these are fundamental for your understanding of coding. I am going to try not to mention any specific programming language in this section, instead leaving it to wider discussion of the core concepts but I will point out some of the quirky features of languages if I think they are of note, you (the reader) don't need to know of the quirkiness of every language but it helps see that these things are mostly the same in every programming language but may have different namesor different syntax.

I would suggest a good place to start this section out would be the [variable](/pages/concepts/variables.md) section.

*Personal anecdote* - Some of this stuff might not "click" into place until you apply it in practice, some of it might not until you re-read some other sections, don't be afraid or skimming the page picking up what you can and doing more and more re-reads. I found when I was starting out that things took a long time for me to fully understand and I had to re-read things multiple times, different people will get stuck on different concepts, don't let it discourage you - get some rest, go for a walk, let the information sink in over time as the famous saying goes "Rome was not built in a day"
