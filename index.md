Hello and welcome - this is a little project of mine, I am always looking for ways to introduce new people into the wonderful world of software development. There is a lot of information out there about this subject and I am just a drop in the ocean of information, but I'm hoping that if someone is struggling with a topic or with something in particular this can be a resource for that one person out there that just needs an extra piece of help.

This website is not intended to be a one stop shop for everything programming, and it will not teach you everything you need to know about the art, the intention here is to equip you with a set of tools that you can wield. The main intention is not to teach you how to code, it's to solve problems through code.

My goal is to help at least one person learn how to code.

Here how I intend on you to use this information:

Sections: 

- Getting started
- Core Concepts
- Finding your voice
- Languages specific knowledge

# Getting started

Before we talk about any code what so ever we have to talk about a few things around why we would want to code and how we should think about what we are doing. Critical thinking, problem solving and breaking things into manageable tasks, these are the things I will talk about in this section, I will try my best not to talk about code what so ever but some might creep in.

# Core Concepts

There are some things that are just the same in every programming language, variables, loops, conditionals, some syntax might change but these are crucial concepts that you need to know to start out your jounrey into software development. 

# Finding Your voice

Let's talk about some of the available languages out there, what they can solve why you might choose one over the other and let's delve into some cold hard facts - like the fact that a the end of the day it doesn't matter what language you program in, most skills are transferable and once you know one C style programming language you know them all.

# Language specific knowledge

Here I will talk about setting up your environment for a specific language, how to get started and walk through a working program, I'll start out with something simple like FizzBuzz but then get into some more advanced problem solving
