Definition:
A data item that may take on more than one value during the runtime of a program.

Variables are everywhere in programs, so what do they do? Variables are there to store information whilst executing a program. I like to think of variables as a box you put something inside of the box and then you label it, let me give an example.

```
let x = 5;
```

Okay if you are following my recommended reading this is the first piece of code that you are seeing, don't be afraid be excited! Here we are creating a new variable the `let` keyword (popular in languages such as javascript) is just to tell the language that we are creating a variable. The word `let` is mathematical in nature, but don't worry we're only going to be doing a small amount of maths here.

Back to the analogy - we have created a box and slapped a label on it the label has the Name `x` written on it, now we can reference that box (we'll talk about scoping much later - let's pretend it doesn't exist for now). Unless we change the contents of that box it will remain the same (the value of 5).

Here is another piece of code - don't worry

```
print(x)
```

This sample is not from any specific language but it gives you a bit of exposure theropy to functions/methods which we will talk about much later. Here we are passing `x` into `print` - now that `print` has that variables in it's grasp it can do certain things with it, let's pretend we are writting a console application and `print` simply prints out the value of `x`, in this example it would print out the value of `x`, which as we learned was 5. If we stick with the box analogy we pass the box to `print`, `print` opens the box takes out the value, sticks it onto the interface in the most appropriate format.

# What can variables do?
Variables are a simple construct that are present in every programming language, they can do a whole host of things, you can add, subtract, compare, multiply.
